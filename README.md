# AccountsManagementSystem
This is the readme file for the repository for group 31 (Shreeya Agarwal &amp; Shuvam Mishra) of ENGG1340.

## Problem Statement:
For the past few years, millenials have been accused for lacking basic financial literacy by the baby-boomer generation. While it is true that a level of negligence has creeped in, the problem lies in the fact that this generation is not as exposed to their finances as their parents which has led to them not speaking about this in the open. What we aim to do is to simply provide people of all ages a simple and easy way to access the basics of their personal finances in a manner that's easy to understand and provides a clear pathway to get back on the right track.


## Problem Setting:
We shall focus on the 5 Ws:

Who: People of all ages; in particular, anyone over 18

What: A system to display, sort and analyse your personal finances by helping you keep a track of your income and expenditure sources

When: Right now, as soon as the project is complete

Where: Worldwide, since this is a public repo

Why: Because we are truly passionate about this project and believe personally in its aims, methods and implementation.

We will use C++ to build this program 
The program shall be built in stages with each stage being built in around a week and will be completed by the the 27th of April, 2019.
For project details, scroll down to Program Features.


## Program Features:

### Required features:
1. Addition of income and expense records
2. Categorisation of the aforementioned records with time and location stamps
3. Editing/Deleting records
4. Provision of monthly records viewable in different ways
5. Statistical report of finances (for example: % of expenses in food, transport, entertainment etc.)
6. Allowance of setting a personal budget

### Additional features:
1. Notification system for exceeding the budget
2. Analysis of current data trends to give suggestions on how to meet monthly budget
3. Forecasting of next month's budget, income and expense charts based on historical data
4. Provision for automatic deduction of upcoming planned payments

As a team, we have set our goals to completing **all of the 6 required features** and as many additional features we find **possible**.

## Outcomes:
As a result of the program, we plan to *place power back in the hands of the consumer* by giving them a detailed analysis of their finances.  

As one of the team members has realised by tracking his expenses in a spreadsheet for the past few months - more than anything else, running a personal finance experiment of this sort gives you a lot of freedom and is, by nature, very empowering.
